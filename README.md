Algorithms Dashboard
This project is an interactive web-based dashboard built with Streamlit that provides a visual and practical exploration of various algorithms. The application allows users to select from a wide range of algorithms, including sorting, search, optimization, and dynamic programming, to see how they work. It serves as a comprehensive educational tool for understanding the core concepts behind these algorithms.

Features
A user-friendly sidebar allows you to easily switch between different algorithms.The dashboard covers fundamental topics such as:
- Sorting: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort
- Search: Binary Search
- Optimization: Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using multiple approaches (Genetic, Brute Force, etc.) and Knapsack problems.
- Greedy Algorithms: Fractional Knapsack, Coin Change.
